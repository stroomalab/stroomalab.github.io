  abstract = {Cells from lung and other tissues are subjected to forces of opposing directions that are largely transmitted through integrin-mediated adhesions. How cells respond to force bidirectionality remains ill defined. To address this question, we nanofabricated flat-ended cylindrical Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) tips with {$\sim$}1 \textmu m2 cross-section area. Tips were uncoated or coated with either integrin-specific (RGD) or non-specific (RGE/BSA) molecules, brought into contact with lung epithelial cells or fibroblasts for 30 s to form focal adhesion precursors, and used to probe cell resistance to deformation in compression and extension. We found that cell resistance to compression was globally higher than to extension regardless of the tip coating. In contrast, both tip-cell adhesion strength and resistance to compression and extension were the highest when probed at integrin-specific adhesions. These integrin-specific mechanoresponses required an intact actin cytoskeleton, and were dependent on tyrosine phosphatases and Ca2+ signaling. Cell asymmetric mechanoresponse to compression and extension remained after 5 minutes of tip-cell adhesion, revealing that asymmetric resistance to force directionality is an intrinsic property of lung cells, as in most soft tissues. Our findings provide new insights on how lung cells probe the mechanochemical properties of the microenvironment, an important process for migration, repair and tissue homeostasis.},

The unique ability of atomic force microscopy (AFM) to probe quantitatively mechanical properties and forces at the nanometer or micrometer scales in all kinds of biological samples has been instrumental in the recent advances in cell and tissue mechanics. In this review we illustrate how AFM has provided important insights on our current understanding of the mechanobiology of cells, ECM and cell-ECM bidirectional interactions, particularly in the context of soft acinar tissues like the mammary gland or pulmonary tissue. AFM measurements have revealed that intrinsic cell micromechanics is cell-type specific, and have underscored the prominent role of {$\beta$}1 integrin/FAK(Y397) signaling and the actomyosin cytoskeleton in the mechanoresponses of both parenchymal and stromal cells. Moreover AFM has unveiled that the micromechanics of the ECM obtained by tissue decellularization is unique for each anatomical compartment, which may support both its specific function and cell differentiation. AFM has also enabled identifying critical mechanoregulatory proteins involved in branching morphogenesis (MMP14) and acinar differentiation ({$\alpha$}3{$\beta$}1 integrin), and has clarified the role of altered tissue mechanics and architecture in a variety of pathologic conditions. Critical technical issues of AFM mechanical measurements like tip geometry effects are also discussed.},

  abstract = {The structure and function of each individual mammary epithelial cell (MEC) is largely controlled by a bidirectional interchange of chemical and mechanical signals with the microenvironment. Most of these signals are tissue-specific, since they arise from the three-dimensional (3D) tissue organization and are modulated during mammary gland development, maturation, pregnancy, lactation, and involution. Although the important role played by structural and mechanical signals in mammary cell and tissue function is being increasingly recognized, quantitative biomechanical approaches are still scarce. Here we review currently available biomechanical tools that allow quantitative examination of individual cells, groups of cells or full monolayers in two-dimensional cultures, and cells in 3D cultures. Current technological limitations and challenges are discussed, with special emphasis on their potential applications in MEC biology. We argue that the combination of biomechanical tools with current efforts in mathematical modeling and in cell and molecular biology applied to 3D cultures provides a powerful approach to unravel the complexity of tissue-specific structure-function relationships.},

  abstract = {Collective cell invasion (CCI) through interstitial collagenous extracellular matrix (ECM) is crucial to the initial stages of branching morphogenesis, and a hallmark of tissue repair and dissemination of certain tumors. The collagenous ECM acts as a mechanical barrier against CCI. However, the physical nature of this barrier and how it is overcome by cells remains incompletely understood. To address these questions, we performed theoretical and experimental analysis of mammary epithelial branching morphogenesis in 3D type I collagen (collagen-I) gels. We found that the mechanical resistance of collagen-I is largely due to its elastic rather than its viscous properties. We also identified two strategies utilized by mammary epithelial cells that can independently minimize ECM mechanical resistance during CCI. First, cells adopt a narrow tube-like geometry during invasion, which minimizes the elastic opposition from the ECM as revealed by theoretical modeling of the most frequent invasive shapes and sizes. Second, the stiffness of the collagenous ECM is reduced at invasive fronts due to its degradation by matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), as indicated by direct measurements of collagen-I microelasticity by atomic force microscopy. Molecular techniques further specified that the membrane-bound MMP14 mediates degradation of collagen-I at invasive fronts. Thus, our findings reveal that MMP14 is necessary to efficiently reduce the physical restraints imposed by collagen-I during branching morphogenesis, and help our overall understanding of how forces are balanced between cells and their surrounding ECM to maintain collective geometry and mechanical stability during CCI.},

  abstract = {Force measurements with atomic force microscopy (AFM) in liquid are subjected to the hydrodynamic drag force artifact (Fd) due to viscous friction of the cantilever with the liquid. This artifact may be especially relevant in microrheological studies of soft samples. Common approaches estimate Fd at a certain distance above the sample and subtract its value from the contact force measured on the sample. However, this procedure can underestimate Fd at contact. The aim of this work was to assess the effect of the hydrodynamic drag in microrheological AFM measurements of soft samples in liquid at low Reynolds numbers (Re {$<$} 1). Drag forces of water on rectangular and V-shaped cantilevers were measured in noncontact when subjecting the substrate to low-amplitude (35 nm) sinusoidal oscillations at different frequencies (1-200 Hz) and tip-substrate distances (h) (0.2-3 {$\mu$}m). Fd increased proportionally with the relative velocity (v). Moreover, the drag factor b(h) defined as Fd/v rose when the cantilever approached the substrate. Thus, the hydrodynamic drag exhibited locally a pure viscous behavior. Drag factor dependence on distance was well-fitted (r2 {$\approx$} 0.95) by the scaled spherical model b(h) = 6{$\pi\eta$}aeff2/(h + heff), where {$\eta$} is the viscosity of the liquid, aeff is the effective radius of the cantilever, and heff is the effective height of the tip. Drag factor at contact was estimated as b(0) = 1.38 \texttimes{} 10-6 (rectangular) and 1.55 \texttimes{} 10-6 Ns/m (V-shaped) by extrapolating b(h) to h = 0. Drag factor measured at 2 {$\mu$}m underestimated b(0) by 30-50\%. Thus, correction of the hydrodynamic artifact with drag factor measured a few micrometers above the surface could result in substantial errors in AFM microrheological measurements of soft samples. Our results suggest that drag artifact in contact microrheological measurements under low Re can be accurately estimated by b(0). Precise correction of drag artifact could lead to an improvement in scan speed in contact AFM imaging and in pulling speed in force spectroscopy studies.}

The desmoplastic stroma of lung cancer and other solid tumors is rich in tumor-associated fibroblasts (TAFs) exhibiting an activated/myofibroblast-like phenotype. There is growing awareness that TAFs support key steps of tumor progression and are epigenetically reprogrammed compared to healthy fibroblasts. Although the mechanisms underlying such epigenetic reprogramming are incompletely understood, there is increasing evidence that they involve interactions with either cancer cells, pro-fibrotic cytokines such as TGF-{$\beta$}, the stiffening of the surrounding extracellular matrix, smoking cigarette particles and other environmental cues. These aberrant interactions elicit a global DNA hypomethylation and a selective transcriptional repression through hypermethylation of the TGF-{$\beta$} transcription factor SMAD3 in lung TAFs. Likewise, similar DNA methylation changes have been reported in TAFs from other cancer types, as well as histone core modifications and altered microRNA expression. In this review we summarize the evidence of the epigenetic reprogramming of TAFs, how this reprogramming contributes to the acquisition and maintenance of a tumor-promoting phenotype, and how it provides novel venues for therapeutic intervention, with a special focus on lung TAFs.},

Here, we define the processes by which mammary epithelial cells integrate biochemical and mechanical extracellular cues to maintain their differentiated phenotype. We used single cells cultured on top of gels in conditions permissive for {$\beta$}-casein expression using atomic force microscopy to measure the elasticity of the cells and their underlying substrata. We found that maintenance of {$\beta$}-casein expression required both laminin signalling and a `soft' extracellular matrix, as is the case in normal tissues in vivo, and biomimetic intracellular elasticity, as is the case in primary mammary epithelial organoids. Conversely, two hallmarks of breast cancer development, stiffening of the extracellular matrix and loss of laminin signalling, led to the loss of {$\beta$}-casein expression and non-biomimetic intracellular elasticity. Our data indicate that tissue-specific gene expression is controlled by both the tissues' unique biochemical milieu and mechanical properties, processes involved in maintenance of tissue integrity and protection against tumorigenesis.},

G(*)(omega) was computed by correcting force-indentation oscillatory data for the tip-cell contact geometry and for the hydrodynamic viscous drag. Both cell types displayed similar viscoelastic properties. The storage modulus G'(omega) increased with frequency following a power law with exponent approximately 0.2. The loss modulus G"(omega) was approximately 2/3 lower and increased similarly to G'(omega) up to approximately 10 Hz, but exhibited a steeper rise at higher frequencies. The cells showed a weak force dependence of G'(omega) and G"(omega). G(*)(omega) conformed to the power-law model with a structural damping coefficient of approximately 0.3, indicating a coupling of elastic and dissipative processes within the cell. Power-law behavior implies a continuum distribution of stress relaxation time constants. This complex dynamics is consistent with the rheology of soft glassy materials close to a glass transition, thereby suggesting that structural disorder and metastability may be fundamental features of cell architecture.},

Most lung TAFs exhibit an activated phenotype characterized by the expression of {$\alpha$}-SMA and fibrillar collagens. However, the prognostic value of these activation markers in NSCLC remains unclear. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We conducted a quantitative image analysis of {$\alpha$}-SMA immunostaining and picrosirius red staining of fibrillar collagens imaged by bright-field and polarized microscopy, respectively, using tissue microarrays with samples from 220 surgical patients, which elicited a percentage of positive staining area for each marker and patient. RESULTS: Kaplan-Meier curves showed that all TAF activation markers were significantly associated with poor survival, and their prognostic value was independent of TNM staging as revealed by multivariate analysis, which elicited an adjusted increased risk of death after 3\,years of 129\% and 94\% for fibrillar collagens imaged with bright-field (p\,=\,0.004) and polarized light (p\,=\,0.003), respectively, and of 89\% for {$\alpha$}-SMA (p\,=\,0.009). We also found a significant association between all TAF activation markers and tumor necrosis, which is often indicative of hypoxia, supporting a pathologic link between tumor desmoplasia and necrosis/hypoxia. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings identify patients with large histologic coverage of fibrillar collagens and {$\alpha$}-SMA\,+\,TAFs to be at higher risk of recurrence and death, supporting that they could be considered for adjuvant therapy.},

However, the potential of collagen fiber descriptors as a source of clinically relevant biomarkers in NSCLC is largely unknown. Similarly, our understanding of the aberrant collagen organization and associated tumor-promoting effects is very scarce. To address these limitations, we identified a digital pathology approach that can be easily implemented in pathology units based on CT-FIRE software (version 2; https://loci.wisc.edu/software/ctfire) analysis of Picrosirius red (PSR) stains of fibrillar collagens imaged with polarized light (PL). CT-FIRE settings were pre-optimized to assess a panel of collagen fiber descriptors in PSR-PL images of tissue microarrays from surgical NSCLC patients (106 adenocarcinomas [ADC] and 89 squamous cell carcinomas [SCC]). Using this approach, we identified straightness as the single high-accuracy diagnostic collagen fiber descriptor (average area under the curve~= 0.92) and fiber density as the single descriptor consistently associated with a poor prognosis in both ADC and SCC independently of the gold standard based on the TNM staging (hazard ratio, 2.69; 95\% CI, 1.55-4.66; P {$<$} .001). Moreover, we found that collagen fibers were markedly straighter, longer, and more aligned in tumor samples compared to paired samples from uninvolved pulmonary tissue, particularly in ADC, which is indicative of increased tumor stiffening. Consistently, we observed an increase in a panel of stiffness-associated processes in the high collagen fiber density patient group selectively in ADC, including venous/lymphatic invasion, fibroblast activation ({$\alpha$}-smooth muscle actin), and immune evasion (programmed death-ligand 1). Similarly, a transcriptional correlation analysis supported the potential involvement of the major YAP/TAZ pathway in ADC. Our results provide a proof-of-principle to use CT-FIRE analysis of PSR-PL images to assess new collagen fiber-based diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers in pathology units, which may improve the clinical management of patients with surgical NSCLC. Our findings also unveil an aberrant stiff microenvironment in lung ADC that may foster immune evasion and dissemination, encouraging future work to identify therapeutic opportunities.},

NSCLC is histologically classified into adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and other less frequent subtypes. Both subtypes and other solid tumors are increasingly regarded as abnormal organs, highlighting the critical role of the desmoplastic tumor stroma rich in cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) in driving tumor progression and therapeutic resistance. This tumor stroma resembles a chronic fibrotic wound and is largely formed by activated/myofibroblast-like {$\alpha$}-SMA+ CAFs (myCAFs), which are strongly associated with immunosuppression and poor prognosis. Despite the dominance of the myCAF phenotype, we reported a decade ago phenotypic alterations in NSCLC with a strong dependence on the histologic subtype. Subsequent studies using functional assays, single-cell techniques, and in vivo models have refined these initial observations, enhancing our understanding of the biology of both normal fibroblasts/myofibroblasts and CAFs in NSCLC and other cancer types, including their origins, subclassification, and physiopathologic functions. Notably, increasing evidence supports that CAFs can exhibit tumor-restraining or tumor-promoting effects, and current therapeutic efforts aim to shift the balance towards tumor-restraining phenotypes. Here, we review major advances in our understanding of tumor stromagenesis and CAF heterogeneity in both primary tumors and metastasis, including emerging consensus, with a special focus on NSCLC and its frequent dissemination to the brain. We also highlight the critical role of smoking through epigenetic reprogramming of the TGF-{$\beta$}/SMAD3 pathway. These advances are beginning to delineate how CAF heterogeneity depends on the stage and histologic subtype in NSCLC.},

In this context, the balance between matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and their tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs) is lost. Interestingly, several MMPs are overexpressed during PF and exhibit a clear profibrotic role (MMP-2, -3, -8, -11, -12 and -28), but a few are antifibrotic (MMP-19), have both profibrotic and antifibrotic capacity (MMP7), or execute an unclear (MMP-1, -9, -10, -13, -14) or unknown function. TIMPs are also overexpressed in PF; hence, the modulation and function of MMPs and TIMP are more complex than expected. EMMPRIN/CD147 (also known as basigin) is a transmembrane glycoprotein from the immunoglobulin superfamily (IgSF) that was first described to induce MMP activity in fibroblasts. It also interacts with other molecules to execute non-related MMP aactions well-described in cancer progression, migration, and invasion. Emerging evidence strongly suggests that CD147 plays a key role in PF not only by MMP induction but also by stimulating fibroblast myofibroblast transition. In this review, we study the structure and function of MMPs, TIMPs and CD147 in PF and their complex crosstalk between them.},

In 3D cultures, physiologic oxygen tension was achieved after 2 days in dense ({$\geq$}3 mg/mL) but not sparse gels, revealing that the latter gels are not suitable tissue surrogates in terms of oxygen distribution. In dense gels, we observed a dominant effect of ECM composition over density in oxygen consumption. All diffusion and consumption data were used in a simple model to estimate ranges for gel thickness, seeding density and time-window that may support physiologic oxygen tension. Thus, we identified critical variables for oxygen tension in ECM gels, and introduced a model to assess initial values of these variables, which may short-cut the optimization step of 3D culture studies.},

  abstract = {Tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 (TIMP-1) is an important regulator of extracellular matrix turnover that has been traditionally regarded as a potential tumor suppressor owing to its inhibitory effects of matrix metalloproteinases. Intriguingly, this interpretation has been challenged by the consistent observation that increased expression of TIMP-1 is associated with poor prognosis in virtually all cancer types including lung cancer, supporting a tumor-promoting function. However, how TIMP-1 is dysregulated within the tumor microenvironment and how it drives tumor progression in lung cancer is poorly understood. We analyzed the expression of TIMP-1 and its cell surface receptor CD63 in two major lung cancer subtypes: lung adenocarcinoma (ADC) and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), and defined the tumor-promoting effects of their interaction. We found that TIMP-1 is aberrantly overexpressed in tumor-associated fibroblasts (TAFs) in ADC compared to SCC. Mechanistically, TIMP-1 overexpression was mediated by the selective hyperactivity of the pro-fibrotic TGF-{$\beta$}1/SMAD3 pathway in ADC-TAFs. Likewise, CD63 was upregulated in ADC compared to SCC cells. Genetic analyses revealed that TIMP-1 secreted by TGF-{$\beta$}1-activated ADC-TAFs is both necessary and sufficient to enhance growth and invasion of ADC cancer cells in culture, and that tumor cell expression of CD63 was required for these effects. Consistently, in vivo analyses revealed that ADC cells co-injected with fibroblasts with reduced SMAD3 or TIMP-1 expression into immunocompromised mice attenuated tumor aggressiveness compared to tumors bearing parental fibroblasts. We also found that high TIMP1 and CD63 mRNA levels combined define a stronger prognostic biomarker than TIMP1 alone. Our results identify an excessive stromal TIMP-1 within the tumor microenvironment selectively in lung ADC, and implicate it in a novel tumor-promoting TAF-carcinoma crosstalk, thereby pointing to TIMP-1/CD63 interaction as a novel therapeutic target in lung cancer.},

  abstract = {The fibrotic tumor microenvironment is a pivotal therapeutic target. Nintedanib, a clinically approved multikinase antifibrotic inhibitor, is effective against lung adenocarcinoma (ADC) but not squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). Previous studies have implicated the secretome of tumor-associated fibroblasts (TAFs) in the selective effects of nintedanib in ADC, but the driving factor(s) remained unidentified. Here we examined the role of tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 (TIMP-1), a tumor-promoting cytokine overproduced in ADC-TAFs. To this aim, we combined genetic approaches with in~vitro and in~vivo preclinical models based on patient-derived TAFs. Nintedanib reduced TIMP-1 production more efficiently in ADC-TAFs than SCC-TAFs through a SMAD3-dependent mechanism. Cell culture experiments indicated that silencing TIMP1 in ADC-TAFs abolished the therapeutic effects of nintedanib on cancer cell growth and invasion, which were otherwise enhanced by the TAF secretome. Consistently, co-injecting ADC cells with TIMP1-knockdown ADC-TAFs into immunocompromised mice elicited a less effective reduction of tumor growth and invasion under nintedanib treatment compared to tumors bearing unmodified fibroblasts. Our results unveil a key mechanism underlying the selective mode of action of nintedanib in ADC based on the excessive production of TIMP-1 in ADC-TAFs. We further pinpoint reduced SMAD3 expression and consequent limited TIMP-1 production in SCC-TAFs as key for the resistance of SCC to nintedanib. These observations strongly support the emerging role of TIMP-1 as a critical regulator of therapy response in solid tumors.},

Unlike EMT, myofibroblasts contribute to tissue stiffening through their contractility and expression of fibrillar collagens, which is associated with aberrant FAK (Y397) hyperactivation., The contribution of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) to the profibrotic stiff microenvironment and myofibroblast accumulation in pulmonary fibrosis remains unclear. We examined EMT-competent lung epithelial cells and lung fibroblasts from control (fibrosis-free) donors or patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), which is a very aggressive fibrotic disorder. Cells were cultured on profibrotic conditions including stiff substrata and TGF-{$\beta$}1, and analyzed in terms of morphology, stiffness, and expression of EMT/myofibroblast markers and fibrillar collagens. All fibroblasts acquired a robust myofibroblast phenotype on TGF-{$\beta$}1 stimulation. Yet IPF myofibroblasts exhibited higher stiffness and expression of fibrillar collagens than control fibroblasts, concomitantly with enhanced FAKY397 activity. FAK inhibition was sufficient to decrease fibroblast stiffness and collagen expression, supporting that FAKY397 hyperactivation may underlie the aberrant mechanobiology of IPF fibroblasts. In contrast, cells undergoing EMT failed to reach the values exhibited by IPF myofibroblasts in all parameters examined. Likewise, EMT could be distinguished from nonactivated control fibroblasts, suggesting that EMT does not elicit myofibroblast precursors either. Our data suggest that EMT does not contribute directly to the myofibroblast population, and may contribute to the stiff fibrotic microenvironment through their own stiffness but not their collagen expression. Our results also support that targeting FAKY397 may rescue normal mechanobiology in IPF.},

Fibroblasts are key regulators of tissue mechanics in the lungs and other organs. However, the effects of IL-1{$\beta$} on fibroblast mechanics and functions remain unclear. Here we treated human pulmonary fibroblasts from control donors with IL-1{$\beta$} and used Atomic Force Microscopy to unveil that IL-1{$\beta$} significantly reduces the stiffness of fibroblasts concomitantly with a downregulation of filamentous actin (F-actin) and alpha-smooth muscle ({$\alpha$}-SMA). Likewise, COL1A1 mRNA was reduced, whereas that of collagenases MMP1 and MMP2 were upregulated, favoring a reduction of type-I collagen. These mechanobiology changes were functionally associated with reduced proliferation and enhanced migration upon IL-1{$\beta$} stimulation, which could facilitate lung repair by drawing fibroblasts to sites of tissue damage. Our observations reveal that IL-1{$\beta$} may reduce local tissue rigidity by acting both intracellularly and extracellularly through the downregulation of fibroblast contractility and type I collagen deposition, respectively. These IL-1{$\beta$}-dependent mechanical effects may enhance lung repair further by locally increasing pulmonary tissue compliance to preserve normal lung distension and function. Moreover, our results support that IL-1{$\beta$} provides innate anti-fibrotic protection that may be relevant during the early stages of lung repair.},

METHODS: We examined the potential role of tumour-associated fibroblasts (TAFs) in the differential effects of nintedanib in ADC and SCC. Because TAFs are largely quiescent and activated in histologic sections, we focused on the antifibrotic effects of nintedanib on TAFs stimulated with the potent fibroblast activator TGF-{$\beta$}1, which is upregulated in lung cancer. RESULTS: Nintedanib dose-dependently inhibited the TGF-{$\beta$}1-induced expression of a panel of pro-fibrotic activation markers in both ADC-TAFs and control fibroblasts derived from uninvolved lung parenchyma, whereas such inhibition was very modest in SCC-TAFs. Remarkably, nintedanib abrogated the stimulation of growth and invasion in a panel of carcinoma cell lines induced by secreted factors from activated TAFs in ADC but not SCC, thereby supporting that TGF-{$\beta$} signalling and aberrant TAF-carcinoma cross-talk is regulated by different mechanisms in ADC and SCC. CONCLUSIONS: These results reveal that nintedanib is an effective inhibitor of fibrosis and its associated tumour-promoting effects in ADC, and that the poor antifibrotic response of SCC-TAFs to nintedanib may contribute to the differential clinical benefit observed in both subtypes. Our findings also support that preclinical models based on carcinoma-TAF interactions may help defining the mechanisms of the poor antifibrotic response of SCC-TAFs to nintedanib and testing new combined therapies to further expand the therapeutic effects of this drug in solid tumours.},

To address these limitations, we set up a cost-effective diffusivity assay based on a Transwell plate and the spectrophotometer of a Microplate Reader, which are readily accessible to cell biology groups. The spectrophotometer-based assay was used to assess the apparent diffusivity D of FITC-dextrans with molecular weight (4-70kDa) spanning the physiological range of signaling factors in a panel of acellular ECM gels including Matrigel, fibrin and type I collagen. Despite their technical differences, D data exhibited {$\sim$}15\% relative difference with respect to FRAP measurements. Our results revealed that diffusion hindrance of small particles is controlled by the enhanced viscosity of the ECM gel in conformance with the Stokes-Einstein equation rather than by geometrical factors. Moreover, we provided a strong rationale that the enhanced ECM viscosity is largely contributed to by unassembled ECM macromolecules. We also reported that gels with the lowest D exhibited diffusion hindrance closest to the large physiologic hindrance of brain tissue, which has a typical pore size much smaller than ECM gels. Conversely, sparse gels ({$\leq$}1mg/ml), which are extensively used in 3D cultures, failed to reproduce the hindered diffusion of tissues, thereby supporting that dense (but not sparse) ECM gels are suitable tissue surrogates in terms of macromolecular transport. Finally, the consequences of reduced diffusivity in terms of optimizing the design of 3D culture experiments were addressed in detail.},

For this purpose we cultured fibroblasts from IPF patients or control donors on hydrogels with tunable elasticity, including 3D collagen-I gels and 2D polyacrylamide (PAA) gels. We found that TGF-{$\beta$}1 consistently increased COL1A1 while decreasing MMP1 mRNA levels in hydrogels exhibiting pre-fibrotic or fibrotic-like rigidities concomitantly with an enhanced activation of the FAK/Akt pathway, whereas FAK depletion was sufficient to abrogate these effects. We also demonstrate a synergy between matrix stiffening and TGF-{$\beta$}1 that was positive for COL1A1 and negative for MMP1. Remarkably, the COL1A1 expression upregulation elicited by TGF-{$\beta$}1 alone or synergistically with matrix stiffening were higher in IPF-fibroblasts compared to control fibroblasts in association with larger FAK and Akt activities in the former cells.

Intriguingly, a trial with the antifibrotic drug nintedanib in non-small cell lung cancer reported clinical benefits in adenocarcinoma (ADC) but not squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), even though the stroma is fibrotic in both histotypes. Likewise, we reported that nintedanib inhibited the tumor-promoting fibrotic phenotype of TAFs selectively in ADC. Here we show that tumor fibrosis is actually higher in ADC-TAFs than SCC-TAFs in vitro and patient samples. Mechanistically, the reduced fibrosis and nintedanib response of SCC-TAFs was associated with increased promoter methylation of the profibrotic TGF{$\beta$} transcription factor SMAD3 compared with ADC-TAFs, which elicited a compensatory increase in TGF{$\beta$}1/SMAD2 activation. Consistently, forcing global DNA demethylation of SCC-TAFs with 5-AZA rescued TGF{$\beta$}1/SMAD3 activation, whereas genetic downregulation of SMAD3 in ADC-TAFs and control fibroblasts increased TGF{$\beta$}1/SMAD2 activation, and reduced their fibrotic phenotype and antitumor responses to nintedanib in vitro and in vivo. Our results also support that smoking and/or the anatomic location of SCC in the proximal airways, which are more exposed to cigarette smoke particles, may prime SCC-TAFs to stronger SMAD3 epigenetic repression, because cigarette smoke condensate selectively increased SMAD3 promoter methylation. Our results unveil that the histotype-specific regulation of tumor fibrosis in lung cancer is mediated through differential SMAD3 promoter methylation in TAFs and provide new mechanistic insights on the selective poor response of SCC-TAFs to nintedanib. Moreover, our findings support that patients with ADC may be more responsive to antifibrotic drugs targeting their stromal TGF{$\beta$}1/SMAD3 activation. SIGNIFICANCE: This study implicates the selective epigenetic repression of SMAD3 in SCC-TAFs in the clinical failure of nintedanib in SCC and supports that patients with ADC may benefit from antifibrotic drugs targeting stromal TGF{$\beta$}1/SMAD3.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The TGF-{$\beta$}1 transcription factor SMAD3 is epigenetically repressed in tumour-associated fibroblasts (TAFs) from lung squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) but not adenocarcinoma (ADC) patients, which elicits a compensatory increase in SMAD2 that renders SCC-TAFs less fibrotic. Here we examined the effects of altered SMAD2/3 in fibroblast migration and its impact on the desmoplastic stroma formation in lung cancer. METHODS: We used a microfluidic device to examine descriptors of early protrusions and subsequent migration in 3D collagen gels upon knocking down SMAD2 or SMAD3 by shRNA in control fibroblasts and TAFs. RESULTS: High SMAD3 conditions as in shSMAD2 fibroblasts and ADC-TAFs exhibited a migratory advantage in terms of protrusions (fewer and longer) and migration (faster and more directional) selectively without TGF-{$\beta$}1 along with Erk1/2 hyperactivation. This enhanced migration was abrogated by TGF-{$\beta$}1 as well as low glucose medium and the MEK inhibitor Trametinib. In contrast, high SMAD2 fibroblasts were poorly responsive to TGF-{$\beta$}1, high glucose and Trametinib, exhibiting impaired migration in all conditions. CONCLUSIONS: The basal migration advantage of high SMAD3 fibroblasts provides a straightforward mechanism underlying the larger accumulation of TAFs previously reported in ADC compared to SCC. Moreover, our results encourage using MEK inhibitors in ADC-TAFs but not SCC-TAFs.},

  abstract = {Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) promote tumour invasion and metastasis. We show that CAFs exert a physical force on cancer cells that enables their collective invasion. Force transmission is mediated by a heterophilic adhesion involving N-cadherin at the CAF membrane and E-cadherin at the cancer cell membrane. This adhesion is mechanically active; when subjected to force it triggers {$\beta$}-catenin recruitment and adhesion reinforcement dependent on {$\alpha$}-catenin/vinculin interaction. Impairment of E-cadherin/N-cadherin adhesion abrogates the ability of CAFs to guide collective cell migration and blocks cancer cell invasion. N-cadherin also mediates repolarization of the CAFs away from the cancer cells. In parallel, nectins and afadin are recruited to the cancer cell/CAF interface and CAF repolarization is afadin dependent. Heterotypic junctions between CAFs and cancer cells are observed in patient-derived material. Together, our findings show that a mechanically active heterophilic adhesion between CAFs and cancer cells enables cooperative tumour~invasion.},

In the presence of laminin-rich ECM (lrECM), mammary epithelial cells round up and undergo global histone deacetylation, a process critical for their functional differentiation. However, it remains unclear whether lrECM-dependent cell rounding and global histone deacetylation are indeed part of a common physical-biochemical pathway. Using 3D cultures as well as nonadhesive and micropatterned substrata, here we showed that the cell 'rounding' caused by lrECM was sufficient to induce deacetylation of histones H3 and H4 in the absence of biochemical cues. Microarray and confocal analysis demonstrated that this deacetylation in 3D culture is associated with a global increase in chromatin condensation and a reduction in gene expression. Whereas cells cultured on plastic substrata formed prominent stress fibers, cells grown in 3D lrECM or on micropatterns lacked these structures. Disruption of the actin cytoskeleton with cytochalasin D phenocopied the lrECM-induced cell rounding and histone deacetylation. These results reveal a novel link between ECM-controlled cell shape and chromatin structure and suggest that this link is mediated by changes in the actin cytoskeleton.},

  abstract = {Senescence in cancer cells acts as a tumor suppressor, whereas in fibroblasts enhances tumor growth. Senescence has been reported in tumor associated fibroblasts (TAFs) from a growing list of cancer subtypes. However, the presence of senescent TAFs in lung cancer remains undefined. We examined senescence in TAFs from primary lung cancer and paired control fibroblasts from unaffected tissue in three major histologic subtypes: adenocarcinoma (ADC), squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and large cell carcinoma (LCC). Three independent senescence markers (senescence-associated beta-galactosidase, permanent growth arrest and spreading) were consistently observed in cultured LCC-TAFs only, revealing a selective premature senescence. Intriguingly, SCC-TAFs exhibited a poor growth response in the absence of senescence markers, indicating a dysfunctional phenotype rather than senescence. Co-culturing normal fibroblasts with LCC (but not ADC or SCC) cancer cells was sufficient to render fibroblasts senescent through oxidative stress, indicating that senescence in LCC-TAFs is driven by heterotypic signaling. In addition, senescent fibroblasts provided selective growth and invasive advantages to LCC cells in culture compared to normal fibroblasts. Likewise, senescent fibroblasts enhanced tumor growth and lung dissemination of tumor cells when co-injected with LCC cells in nude mice beyond the effects induced by control fibroblasts. These results define the subtype-specific aberrant phenotypes of lung TAFs, thereby challenging the common assumption that lung TAFs are a heterogeneous myofibroblast-like cell population regardless of their subtype. Importantly, because LCC often distinguishes itself in the clinic by its aggressive nature, we argue that senescent TAFs may contribute to the selective aggressive behavior of LCC tumors.},

  abstract = {Epithelial cell invasion through the extracellular matrix (ECM) is a crucial step in branching morphogenesis. The mechanisms by which the mammary epithelium integrates cues from the ECM with intracellular signaling in order to coordinate invasion through the stroma to make the mammary tree are poorly understood. Because the cell membrane-bound matrix metalloproteinase Mmp14 is known to play a key role in cancer cell invasion, we hypothesized that it could also be centrally involved in integrating signals for mammary epithelial cells (MECs) to navigate the collagen 1 (CL-1)-rich stroma of the mammary gland. Expression studies in nulliparous mice that carry a NLS-lacZ transgene downstream of the Mmp14 promoter revealed that Mmp14 is expressed in MECs at the tips of the branches. Using both mammary organoids and 3D organotypic cultures, we show that MMP activity is necessary for invasion through dense CL-1 (3 mg/ml) gels, but dispensable for MEC branching in sparse CL-1 (1 mg/ml) gels. Surprisingly, however, Mmp14 without its catalytic activity was still necessary for branching. Silencing Mmp14 prevented cell invasion through CL-1 and disrupted branching altogether; it also reduced integrin {$\beta$}1 (Itgb1) levels and attenuated MAPK signaling, disrupting Itgb1-dependent invasion/branching within CL-1 gels. FRET imaging revealed that Mmp14 associates directly with Itgb1. We identified a domain of Mmp14 that is required for modulating the levels of Itgb1, MEC signaling and the rate of invasion within CL-1. These results shed light on hitherto undescribed non-proteolytic activities of Mmp14 that are necessary for the Itgb1-dependent biochemical and mechanical signals that regulate branching in the mammary epithelium.},

  abstract = {Mechanical changes in tumors have long been linked to increased malignancy and therapy resistance and attributed to mechanical changes in the tumor extracellular matrix (ECM). However, to the best of our knowledge, there have been no mechanical studies on decellularized tumors. Here, we studied the biochemical and mechanical progression of the tumor ECM in two models of lung metastases: lung carcinoma (CAR) and melanoma (MEL). We decellularized the metastatic lung sections, measured the micromechanics of the tumor ECM, and stained the sections for ECM proteins, proliferation, and cell death markers. The same methodology was applied to MEL mice treated with the clinically approved anti-fibrotic drug nintedanib. When compared to healthy ECM (\textasciitilde 0.40 kPa), CAR and MEL lung macrometastases produced a highly dense and stiff ECM (1.79 \textpm{} 1.32 kPa, CAR and 6.39 \textpm{} 3.37 kPa, MEL). Fibronectin was overexpressed from the early stages (\textasciitilde 118\%) to developed macrometastases (\textasciitilde 260\%) in both models. Surprisingly, nintedanib caused a 4-fold increase in ECM-occupied tumor area (5.1 \textpm{} 1.6\% to 18.6 \textpm{} 8.9\%) and a 2-fold in-crease in ECM stiffness (6.39 \textpm{} 3.37 kPa to 12.35 \textpm{} 5.74 kPa). This increase in stiffness strongly correlated with an increase in necrosis, which reveals a potential link between tumor hypoxia and ECM deposition and stiffness. Our findings highlight fibronectin and tumor ECM mechanics as attractive targets in cancer therapy and support the need to identify new anti-fibrotic drugs to abrogate aberrant ECM mechanics in metastases.},

The aim of this study was to evaluate a simple noninvasive method (Delta-inst) of measuring Rrs during nasal pressure support ventilation. Rrs and Ers (Delta-inst) were computed from inspiratory mask pressure, flow and volume recorded during pressure support ventilation. The Delta-inst method was compared with the forced oscillation technique (FOT) in seven patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and in eight healthy subjects without and with added resistance (3.1 cmH2O x s x L(-1)). Rrs measured by Delta-inst (5.2+/-1.7, 7.2+/-0.5 and 6.9+/-1.2 cmH2O x s x L(-1)) and by FOT (5.0+/-0.7, 7.6+/-0.9 and 8.1+/-2.7 cmH2O x s x L(-1)) in healthy subjects without and with added resistance and COPD, respectively, were not significantly different (p{$>$}0.05). Rrs measured by both techniques showed a significant coefficient of linear correlation (r=0.70 s) (p{$<$}0.01). In the COPD patients, the variability of Delta-inst Rrs (30\%) was greater than that of FOT Rrs (21\%). The agreement between Ers obtained by Delta-inst and by FOT was less than that found for Rrs. Delta-inst is a noninvasive and simple method for reliably assessing resistance. Therefore, it is useful for monitoring airway obstruction and is potentially helpful in adapting the settings for pressure support ventilation in accordance with patient mechanics.},

Since the extracellular matrix (ECM) is a major regulator of tissue elasticity and function, several ECM-based models have emerged in the last decades, including in vitro endogenous ECM, decellularized tissue ECM and ECM hydrogels. The development of such models has urged the need to quantify their elastic properties particularly at the nanometer scale, which is the relevant length scale for cell-ECM interactions. For this purpose, the versatility of atomic force microscopy (AFM) to quantify the nanomechanical properties of soft biomaterials like ECM models has emerged as a very suitable technique. In this chapter we provide a detailed protocol on how to assess the Young's elastic modulus of ECM models by AFM, discuss some of the critical issues, and provide troubleshooting guidelines as well as illustrative examples of AFM measurements, particularly in the context of cancer.},

  abstract = {Magnetic twisting cytometry (MTC) (Wang N, Butler JP, and Ingber DE, Science 260: 1124-1127, 1993) is a useful technique for probing cell micromechanics. The technique is based on twisting ligand-coated magnetic microbeads bound to membrane receptors and measuring the resulting bead rotation with a magnetometer. Owing to the low signal-to-noise ratio, however, the magnetic signal must be modulated, which is accomplished by spinning the sample at approximately 10 Hz. Present demodulation approaches limit the MTC range to frequencies {$<$}0.5 Hz. We propose a novel demodulation algorithm to expand the frequency range of MTC measurements to higher frequencies. The algorithm is based on coherent demodulation in the frequency domain, and its frequency range is limited only by the dynamic response of the magnetometer. Using the new algorithm, we measured the complex modulus of elasticity (G*) of cultured human bronchial epithelial cells (BEAS-2B) from 0.03 to 16 Hz. Cells were cultured in supplemented RPMI medium, and ferromagnetic beads (approximately 5 microm) coated with an RGD peptide were bound to the cell membrane. Both the storage (G', real part of G*) and loss (G", imaginary part of G*) moduli increased with frequency as omega(alpha) (2 pi x frequency) with alpha approximately equal to 1/4. The ratio G"/G' was approximately 0.5 and varied little with frequency. Thus the cells exhibited a predominantly elastic behavior with a weak power law of frequency and a nearly constant proportion of elastic vs. frictional stresses, implying that the mechanical behavior conformed to the so-called structural damping (or constant-phase) law (Maksym GN, Fabry B, Butler JP, Navajas D, Tschumperlin DJ, LaPorte JD, and Fredberg JJ, J Appl Physiol 89: 1619-1632, 2000). We conclude that frequency domain demodulation dramatically increases the frequency range that can be probed with MTC and reveals that the mechanics of these cells conforms to constant-phase behavior over a range of frequencies approaching three decades.},

  abstract = {The crucial role of tumor-associated fibroblasts (TAF) in cancer progression is now clear in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, therapies against TAFs are limited due to a lack of understanding in the subtype-specific mechanisms underlying their accumulation. Here, the mechanical (i.e., matrix rigidity) and soluble mitogenic cues that drive the accumulation of TAFs from major NSCLC subtypes: adenocarcinoma (ADC) and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) were dissected. Fibroblasts were cultured on substrata engineered to exhibit normal- or tumor-like stiffnesses at different serum concentrations, and critical regulatory processes were elucidated. In control fibroblasts from nonmalignant tissue, matrix stiffening alone increased fibroblast accumulation, and this mechanical effect was dominant or comparable with that of soluble growth factors up to 0.5\% serum. The stimulatory cues of matrix rigidity were driven by {$\beta$}1 integrin mechano-sensing through FAK (pY397), and were associated with a posttranscriptionally driven rise in {$\beta$}1 integrin expression. The latter mechano-regulatory circuit was also observed in TAFs but in a subtype-specific fashion, because SCC-TAFs exhibited higher FAK (pY397), {$\beta$}1 expression, and ERK1/2 (pT202/Y204) than ADC-TAFs. Moreover, matrix stiffening induced a larger TAF accumulation in SCC-TAFs ({$>$}50\%) compared with ADC-TAFs (10\%-20\%). In contrast, SCC-TAFs were largely serum desensitized, whereas ADC-TAFs responded to high serum concentration only. These findings provide the first evidence of subtype-specific regulation of NSCLC-TAF accumulation. Furthermore, these data support that therapies aiming to restore normal lung elasticity and/or {$\beta$}1 integrin-dependent mechano regulation may be effective against SCC-TAFs, whereas inhibiting stromal growth factor signaling may be effective against ADC-TAFs. IMPLICATIONS: This study reveals distinct mechanisms underlying the abnormal accumulation of tumor-supporting fibroblasts in two major subtypes of lung cancer, which will assist the development of personalized therapies against these cells.},

However, the specific biophysical signaling by which changes in cell shape contribute to cell cycle regulation remains poorly understood. Here, we describe our study of the roles of nuclear volume and cytoskeletal mechanics in mediating shape control of proliferation in single endothelial cells. Micropatterned adhesive islands were used to independently control cell spreading and elongation. We show that, irrespective of elongation, nuclear volume and apparent chromatin decondensation of cells in G1 systematically increased with cell spreading and highly correlated with DNA synthesis (percent of cells in the S phase). In contrast, cell elongation dramatically affected the organization of the actin cytoskeleton, markedly reduced both cytoskeletal stiffness (measured dorsally with atomic force microscopy) and contractility (measured ventrally with traction microscopy), and increased mechanical anisotropy, without affecting either DNA synthesis or nuclear volume. Our results reveal that the nuclear volume in G1 is predictive of the proliferative status of single endothelial cells within a population, whereas cell stiffness and contractility are not. These findings show that the effects of cell mechanics in shape control of proliferation are far more complex than a linear or straightforward relationship. Our data are consistent with a mechanism by which spreading of cells in G1 partially enhances proliferation by inducing nuclear swelling and decreasing chromatin condensation, thereby rendering DNA more accessible to the replication machinery.},

  abstract = {Macrophages are crucial in the body's inflammatory response, with tightly regulated functions for optimal immune system performance. Our study reveals that the RAS-p110{$\alpha$} signalling pathway, known for its involvement in various biological processes and tumorigenesis, regulates two vital aspects of the inflammatory response in macrophages: the initial monocyte movement and later-stage lysosomal function. Disrupting this pathway, either in a mouse model or through drug intervention, hampers the inflammatory response, leading to delayed resolution and the development of more severe acute inflammatory reactions in live models. This discovery uncovers a previously unknown role of the p110{$\alpha$} isoform in immune regulation within macrophages, offering insight into the complex mechanisms governing their function during inflammation. With emerging potential to activate p110{$\alpha$} using small molecules, targeting the RAS-p110{$\alpha$} pathway could be a promising approach for treating chronic inflammation. This therapeutic prospect holds significant promise for easing inflammatory disorders and improving the quality of life for affected patients.},

  abstract = {Myofibroblasts are a population of highly contractile fibroblasts that express and require the activity of the transcription factor Snail1. Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) correlate with low survival of cancer patients when present in the stroma of primary tumors. Remarkably, the presence of myofibroblastic CAFs (which express Snail1) creates mechanical properties in the tumor microenvironment that support metastasis. However, therapeutic blockage of fibroblast activity in patients with cancer is a double-edged sword, as normal fibroblast activities often restrict tumor cell invasion. We used fibroblasts depleted of Snail1 or protein arginine methyltransferases 1 and 4 (PRMT1/-4) to identify specific epigenetic modifications induced by TGF{$\beta$}/Snail1. Furthermore, we analyzed the in vivo efficiency of methyltransferase inhibitors using mouse models of wound healing and metastasis, as well as fibroblasts isolated from patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). Mechanistically, TGF{$\beta$}-induced Snail1 promotes the epigenetic mark of asymmetrically dimethylated arginine. Critically, we found that inhibitors of methyltransferases prevent myofibroblast activity (but not regular fibroblast activity) in the extracellular matrix, both in cell culture and in vivo. In a mouse breast cancer model, the inhibitor sinefungin reduces both the myofibroblast activity in the tumor stroma and the metastatic burden in the lung. Two distinct inhibitors effectively blocked the exacerbated myofibroblast activity of patient-derived IPF fibroblasts. Our data reveal epigenetic regulation of myofibroblast transdifferentiation in both wound healing and in disease (fibrosis and breast cancer). Thus, methyltransferase inhibitors are good candidates as therapeutic reagents for these diseases.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: There is growing interest in the development of cell culture assays that enable the rigidity of the extracellular matrix to be increased. A promising approach is based on three-dimensional collagen type I matrices that are stiffened by cross-linking through non-enzymatic glycation with reducing sugars. METHODS: The present study evaluated the biomechanical changes in the non-enzymatically glycated type I collagen matrices, including collagen organization, the advanced glycation end products formation and stiffness achievement. Gels were glycated with ribose at different concentrations (0, 5, 15, 30 and 240 mM). The viability and the phenotypic changes of primary human lung fibroblasts cultured within the non-enzymatically glycated gels were also evaluated along three consecutive weeks. Statistical tests used for data analyze were Mann-Whitney U, Kruskal Wallis, Student's t-test, two-way ANOVA, multivariate ANOVA, linear regression test and mixed linear model. RESULTS: Our findings indicated that the process of collagen glycation increases the stiffness of the matrices and generates advanced glycation end products in a ribose concentration-dependent manner. Furthermore, we identified optimal ribose concentrations and media conditions for cell viability and growth within the glycated matrices. The microenvironment of this collagen based three-dimensional culture induces {$\alpha$}-smooth muscle actin and tenascin-C fibroblast protein expression. Finally, a progressive contractile phenotype cell differentiation was associated with the contraction of these gels. CONCLUSIONS: The use of non-enzymatic glycation with a low ribose concentration may provide a suitable model with a mechanic and oxidative modified environment with cells embedded in it, which allowed cell proliferation and induced fibroblast phenotypic changes. Such culture model could be appropriate for investigations of the behavior and phenotypic changes in cells that occur during lung fibrosis as well as for testing different antifibrotic therapies in vitro.},

  abstract = {Epigenetic changes through altered DNA methylation have been implicated in critical aspects of tumor progression, and have been extensively studied in a variety of cancer types. In contrast, our current knowledge of the aberrant genomic DNA methylation in tumor-associated fibroblasts (TAFs) or other stromal cells that act as critical coconspirators of tumor progression is very scarce. To address this gap of knowledge, we conducted genome-wide DNA methylation profiling on lung TAFs and paired control fibroblasts (CFs) from non-small cell lung cancer patients using the HumanMethylation450 microarray. We found widespread DNA hypomethylation concomitant with focal gain of DNA methylation in TAFs compared to CFs. The aberrant DNA methylation landscape of TAFs had a global impact on gene expression and a selective impact on the TGF-{$\beta$} pathway. The latter included promoter hypermethylation-associated SMAD3 silencing, which was associated with hyperresponsiveness to exogenous TGF-{$\beta$}1 in terms of contractility and extracellular matrix deposition. In turn, activation of CFs with exogenous TGF-{$\beta$}1 partially mimicked the epigenetic alterations observed in TAFs, suggesting that TGF-{$\beta$}1 may be necessary but not sufficient to elicit such alterations. Moreover, integrated pathway-enrichment analyses of the DNA methylation alterations revealed that a fraction of TAFs may be bone marrow-derived fibrocytes. Finally, survival analyses using DNA methylation and gene expression datasets identified aberrant DNA methylation on the EDARADD promoter sequence as a prognostic factor in non-small cell lung cancer patients. Our findings shed light on the unique origin and molecular alterations underlying the aberrant phenotype of lung TAFs, and identify a stromal biomarker with potential clinical relevance.},
